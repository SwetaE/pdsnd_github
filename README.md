### Exploring US Bike Share Data

#### **Introduction :**

This Project is about a Bikeshare System that is used by three cities 

1. *New York*

2. *Chicago*

3. *Washington*

I used Python 3  to explore the data related to this Project and also used 
Python's Modules- Pandas and Numpy.

#### Datasets & Files  :

The datasets used for this project are randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017.The **CSV** file for these cities contains the following six colums.

- *Start Time*
- *End Time*
- *Trip Duration*
- *Start Station*
- *End Station*
- *User Type*

**Chicago** and **New York City** files also provide the following two columns:

- *Gender*
- *Birth Year*

I used the data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/) which is a bike share system provider for major cities in the United States.

### Description

To start  with :

- A city based filtering is done based on the user's input

- Secondly the data that is extracted from the above filter is again filtered by **Month** or **Day** or **Both Month and Day** or **None** , upon user's input.

- Based on the above filters the following data format is displayed :
  
  #### **Time Statistics :**
  
  '' ***Displays statistics on the most frequent times of travel.***''
  
  1. *Displays the most common month*
  
  2. *Displays the most common day of week*
  
  #### **Station Statistics :**
  
  ''***Displays statistics on the most popular stations and trip.***''
  
  1. *Displays the most commonly used start station*
  
  2. *Displays the most commonly used end station*
  
  3. *Displays the most frequent combination of start station and end station*
  
  #### **Trip Duration Statistics :**
  
  ''***Displays statistics on the total and average trip duration.***''
  
  1. *Displays the total travel time*
  
  2. *Displays the mean travel time*
  
  #### **User Statistics :**
  
  ''***Displays statistics on bikeshare users.***''
  
  1. *Displays the counts of user types*
  
  2. *Displays the counts of gender*
  
  3. *Displays the Earliest Birth Year*
  
  4. *Displays the Most Recent Birth Year*
  
  5. *Displays the Most Common Birth Year*

### Softwares Used & Resources

1. I used Spyder, a Python integrated development environment (IDE) for running the scripts.To install Spyder, you will need to download the [Anaconda installer](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)

2. [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) and [Atom](https://atom.io/)

3. [Mark Text](https://marktext.app/) for md files
   
   The following sourses provided me lot what i needed for my project

1. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
2. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.17.0/)
3.  [Python Documentation]([https://docs.python.org/3/library/)
