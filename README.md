### Exploring US Bike Share Data

###### **Introduction:**

This Project is about a Bikeshare System that is used by three cities 

1.  *New York*

2. *Chicago*

3.  *Washington*

I used Python 3  to explore the data related to this Project and also used 
Python's Modules- Pandas and Numpy.

###### Datasets & Files  :

The datasets used for this project are randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017.The **CSV** file for these cities contains the following six colums.

- *Start Time*
- *End Time*
- *Trip Duration*
- *Start Station*
- *End Station*
- *User Type*

**Chicago** and **New York City** files also provide the following two columns:

- *Gender*
- *Birth Year*

I used the data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/) which is a bike share system provider for major cities in the United States.

### Description

To start of with :

- A city based filtering is done based on the user's input

- Secondly the data that is extracted from the above filter is again filtered by **Month** or **Day** or **Both Month and Day** or **None** , upon user's input.

- Based on the above filters the following data format is displayed :
  
  ##### **Time Statistics:**
